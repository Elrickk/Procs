1. List all zones

Use the following command to list information for all zones. Only partial output is displayed.

# firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
work
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: 
  sources: 
  services: dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports: 
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  sourceports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 

drop
  target: DROP
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: 
  sources: 
  services: 
  ports: 
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  sourceports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 
.....

Public is the default zone set, if you do not change it. To check the currently set default zone use the below command:

# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public

2. List allowed service and ports on the system

To show currently allowed service on your system use the below command.

# firewall-cmd --list-services
dhcpv6-client ssh

To list the ports that are open on your system:

# firewall-cmd --list-ports

You would normally see no ports listed here when you have just enabled the firewalld.
3. To Enable all the incoming ports for a service

You can also open the required ports for a service by using the –add-seervice option. To permit access by HTTP clients for the public zone:

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http
success

To list services that are allowed for the public zone:

# firewall-cmd --zone=work --list-services
dhcpv6-client http ssh

Using this command only changes the Runtime configuration and does not update the configuration files. The following sequence of commands shows that configuration changes made in Runtime configuration mode are lost when the firewalld service is restarted:

# systemctl restart firewalld

# firewall-cmd --zone=work --list-services
dhcpv6-client ssh

To make changes permanent, use the –permanent option. Example:

# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
success

Changes made in Permanent configuration mode are not implemented immediately. Example:

# firewall-cmd --zone=work --list-services
dhcpv6-client ssh

However, changes made in a Permanent configuration are written to configuration files. Restarting the firewalld service reads the configuration files and implements the changes.
Example:

# systemctl restart firewalld

# firewall-cmd --zone=work --list-services
dhcpv6-client http ssh

4. Allow traffic on an incoming port

The command below will open the port 2222 effective immediately, but will not persist across reboots:

# firewall-cmd --add-port=[YOUR PORT]/tcp

For example, to open TCP port 2222 :

# firewall-cmd --add-port=2222/tcp

The following command will create a persistent rule, but will not be put into effect immediately:

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=[YOUR PORT]/tcp

For Example, to open TCP port 2222 :

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp

To list the open ports, use the command :

# firewall-cmd –-list-ports
2222/tcp

5. Start and stop firewalld service

To start/stop/status firewalld service use the below commands:

# systemctl start firewalld.service
# systemctl stop firewalld.service

To check the status of the firewalld service:

# systemctl status firewalld.service
