Installing The Nagios Plugins :

Prerequisites :

Make sure that you have the following packages installed.

# apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget bc gawk dc build-essential snmp libnet-snmp-perl gettext

 
Downloading The Source :

# cd /tmp
# wget --no-check-certificate -O nagios-plugins.tar.gz https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/archive/release-2.2.1.tar.gz
# tar zxf nagios-plugins.tar.gz


Compile + Install :

# cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-release-2.2.1/
# ./tools/setup
# ./configure
# make
# make install




Install NRPE :


Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following packages installed.

apt-get update
apt-get install -y autoconf automake gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget


Downloading the Source 

# cd /tmp
# wget --no-check-certificate -O nrpe.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/archive/nrpe-3.2.1.tar.gz
# tar xzf nrpe.tar.gz


Compile

Note that if you want to pass arguments through NRPE you must specify this in the configuration option as indicated below. If you prefer to you can omit the --enable-command-args flag. Removing this flag will require that all arguments be explicitly set in the nrpe.cfg file on each server monitored.

# cd /tmp/nrpe-nrpe-3.2.1/
# ./configure --enable-command-args
# make all



Create User And Group

This creates the nagios user and group.

# make install-groups-users


Install Binaries
# make install


Install Configuration Files

This installs the config files.

# make install-config



Update Services File

The /etc/services file is used by applications to translate human readable service names into port numbers when connecting to a machine across a network.

# echo >> /etc/services
# echo '# Nagios services' >> /etc/services
# echo 'nrpe    5666/tcp' >> /etc/services



Install Service / Daemon

# make install-init
# systemctl enable nrpe.service


Configure Firewall

Port 5666 is used by NRPE and needs to be opened on the local firewall.

# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 5666 -j ACCEPT

# apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
Answer yes to saving existing rules

iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rule




Update Configuration File

The file nrpe.cfg is where the following settings will be defined. It is located:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg



allowed_hosts=

At this point NRPE will only listen to requests from itself (127.0.0.1). If you wanted your nagios server to be able to connect, add it's IP address after a comma (in this example it's 10.25.5.2):

allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,10.25.5.2

 

dont_blame_nrpe=

This option determines whether or not the NRPE daemon will allow clients to specify arguments to commands that are executed. We are going to allow this, as it enables more advanced NPRE configurations.

dont_blame_nrpe=1




# systemctl start nrpe.service



Test NRPE

Now check that NRPE is listening and responding to requests.

/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_nrpe -H 127.0.0.1

 You should see the output similar to the following:

NRPE v3.2.1

If you get the NRPE version number (as shown above), NRPE is installed and configured correctly.

You can also test from your Nagios host by executing the same command above, but instead of 127.0.0.1 you will need to replace that with the IP Address / DNS name of the machine with NRPE running.
